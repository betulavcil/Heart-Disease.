Hello, I am Betul.

I am doing some exercises to improve myself and my skills in the field of Data Science. 

I hope the projects I have made will help beginners and those who want to improve themselves like me.

You can find the datasets I used in the *datasets* folder and the analysis files in the *analysis_folder*.


# MY STUDIES:

* Example of EDA with HeartDisease dataset: C:\Users\avcil\projects\data science projects\analysis_folder\EDA_heartdisease.ipynb
